Solution Usage Guide
This document provides guidance on using the Solution class to solve problems.

Steps to Use the Solution
Create an Instance
Initialize an instance of the Solution class to access its methods.
Example:
python
Copy code
solver = Solution()
Define Your Input
Set up the input data according to the problem's specifications.
Example:
python
Copy code
input_data = [1, 2, 3]
Call the Method
Use the instance to call the relevant method with your input.
Example:
python
Copy code
result = solver.methodName(input_data)
Print the Result
Display the output returned by the method.
Example:
python
Copy code
print(result)
Use these steps for object creation and method invocation in your solution. Adjust examples as needed for your specific problem.
